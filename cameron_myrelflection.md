I pulled these answers from my GPS when I was in Purple Martins. I didnt have to answer these exact questions and dont remember the session well enough to provide answers for a couple of these. 
1. I was struggling with remembering to create a feature branch and not push to the master. I still did it in my session and had to go back.
2. That checkout moves you to different branch.
3. N/A
4. N/A
5. I was extremely nervous beforehand. But it went well. I think everytime it will be different due to how roles are defined. But afterwads I felt great coming out of it. I thought having people watch me would hinder my performance but I didnt feel watched but supported. -->
